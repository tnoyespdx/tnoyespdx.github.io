              <p>
                Currently enrolled in the Master's of Computer Science program
                at Portland State University, with an emphasis in Cybersecurity.
                My expected completion is Spring 2024. I spend my free time
                studying industry standards and security tools!
              </p>
              <p>
                My recent experience includes internal security systems
                implementation, documentation, and IT management for Portland
                State University. I've been a teaching assistant in multiple
                Computer Science courses, and volunteer many hours per week
                mentoring other students in both IT fundamentals and
                cybersecurity.
              </p>
              <p>
                My past experience as a Remote Channel Deposit Verification
                agent was investigating ATM and Mobile deposit fraud. I have a
                passion for financial crime investigations. I love taking on
                roles that make me think outside the box. My preferred work
                experience is in a fast-paced corporate environment. I enjoy
                being part of a team, but can work independently with little
                supervision. I am driven by getting results. I thrive when
                accomplishing big goals under pressure. I love the feeling of
                finishing a hard days work.
              </p>
              <p>
                Always punctual, eager to learn, and aspiring for a career that
                pushes me to new limits. My main skills are computer
                programming, information security, IT, analytical task work,
                fraud investigation, consultative sales, customer service, and
                technical writing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of my interests outside of work include hiking, camping,
                drawing, cooking delicious food from all cultures, and spending
                time with my dog. I love to travel, often hopping on a plane for
                the weekend just to get out of town. I'm always looking for fun
                places to visit and have new experiences!

              <h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
              <p>
                Wrote a program in Python that solves any Suduko puzzle. This
                was the final project for my CS350 Algorithms and Complexity
                class. It uses an advanced backtracking method to go through
                each line of the board and fill in the correct choices. Code can
                be found here: [link will be updated soon]

              <h2>Sandwich Board</h2>
              <p>
                Designed a large format graphic to be placed on the sign outside
                the Computer Action Team at PSU. This was my first major graphic
                created for fun, and it was made using Google Drawings. After
                making this graphic I have also made many other promotional
                materials for the CAT, and plan to keep making more when I have
                free time!

              <h2>Blackjack Game</h2>
              <p>
                Wrote a BlackJack game using Python. This was one of my first
                ever coding projects, and one that I would love to remake some
                day soon! It uses inheritance, objects, and even has advanced
                features like splitting a hand. Code can be found here: [link
